Article 3 - Proof of Loss Written proof of loss must be sent to The Principal within 90 days after the date of the loss. Proof required includes the date, nature, and extent of the loss. The Principal may request additional information to substantiate loss or require a Signed unaltered authorization to obtain that information from the provider.

The death must occur as a direct result of an accident and within a specified period, which varies between 90 to 180 days depending on the policy.  \n            **Citations:**  \n            Document 1: Policy X, Page 5  \n            Document 2: Policy Y, Page 12  \n            Document 3: Policy Z, Page 7\n\n            ### Example 2: Query about Exclusions\n            **Query:**  \n            Are there any exclusions for pre-existing conditions in this policy?\n\n            **Top 3 RAG Results:**  \n            - **Document 1:** \"This policy excludes coverage for any conditions that were diagnosed or treated within 12 months prior to the policy's start date.

This request must be signed by you as the policyholder, and the change will take effect once the insurance company has received and acknowledged it.  \n            **Citations:**  \n            Document 1: Policy X, Page 3  \n            Document 2: Policy Y, Page 6  \n            Document 3: Policy Z, Page 4\n\n            ### Example 4: Complex Query about Premium Payments\n            **Query:**  \n            What are the options if I miss a premium payment?\n\n            **Top 3 RAG Results:**  \n            - **Document 1:** \"If a premium payment is missed, the policyholder typically has a 30-day grace period to make the payment without penalty.
